# Here's how to configure things to get your set up and ready to use this repository

What you'll need:

    - IDE (Pycharm / VS Code)

    - MySQL Workbench

    - Terminal / Commandline


Step 1. 

    Clone the repository - [guide to cloning a repository here.](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) 


Step 2. 

    In terminal / commandline, navigate to the repository files on your machine


Step 3. 

    Create or enter a virtual environment - [set up guide for virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)


Step 4. 

    In your terminal, enter pip install -r requirements.txt. This will install all the packages you'll need to run the program. 


Step. 5

    Head to your IDE (VS Code / Pycharm etc) where you'll open the folder of your cloned repository, you can view all the files in here.


Step. 6

    To run the files, in terminal have your tab with the virtual environment open and run `python -m flask --app app run`

Step. 7

    In the second tab, run python main.py. This tab will allow you to run through the functionality where you can view the books available, leave a review for a book, view the waitlist for upcoming books, and also purchase a book. 

Step. 8

    To exit the program, enter exit when you're prompted for what you'd like to do next.
