[.gitignore](https://github.com/Deena-k1/Git.assignment/blob/main/.gitignore) - This folder is used to add any files you wish to not commit. 

[requirements.txt](https://github.com/Deena-k1/Git.assignment/blob/main/docs/requirements.txt) - requirements.txt is a file that contains a list of packages or libraries needed to work on a project that can all be installed with the file. You can use the following code to install all the libraries and packages in the file:
`pip install -r /path/to/requirements.txt`
(Insert your own file path leading to the requirements.txt file)
